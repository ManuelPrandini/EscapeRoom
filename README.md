# EscapeRoom
This is the project made during my bachelor thesis. An escape room made with Unity3d, designed for people with neurocognitive diseases.
Unity3d was used to implement the entire serious game.
Some models inside are imported from various 3d model web sites, while the home design is created by me, using
SketchUp Make and Blender.
